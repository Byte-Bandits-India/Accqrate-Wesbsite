        Introduction: The Changing Landscape of POS Systems in Saudi Arabia
      </h3>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Point of Sales (POS) systems are critical to improving customer satisfaction and ensuring seamless
        business operations. However, with the launch of{" "}
        <b>E-invoicing Phase 2 by ZATCA (Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority),</b> businesses in Saudi Arabia
        face new challenges in integrating legacy POS systems with ZATCA’s compliance requirements.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Our research reveals that <b>30–40% of businesses</b> continue to use outdated, standalone POS
        machines that cannot communicate with external systems like ZATCA. Migrating to a modern POS system
        isn’t always feasible, especially for businesses heavily reliant on their existing setup.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">
        The Challenge: Integrating Legacy POS Systems with ZATCA
      </h3>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Many POS machines currently in use are built on obsolete technology and lack the capability to
        integrate with external systems like ZATCA. Below are the key challenges businesses face when trying
        to achieve compliance:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">
        Key Obstacles in POS–ZATCA Integration
      </h3>

      <ul className="story pl-5 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>
          <b>Obsolete Technology:</b> Legacy POS applications are outdated and lack the scalability to
          integrate with modern APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Offline Functionality:</b> Most POS systems operate offline, storing data locally and performing
          reconciliation at the end of the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Customer Experience:</b> Any changes to POS systems must not increase{" "}
          <b>customer waiting time</b>, as this can impact satisfaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Inbuilt Print Formats:</b> Many POS devices have fixed invoice formats that are not customizable
          to include QR codes or ZATCA-compliant details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">
        The Solution: Accqrate POS ZATCA Integrator
      </h3>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        To address these challenges, <b>Accqrate</b> developed a range of <b>POS integrators</b> that
        provide seamless <b>ZATCA compliance</b> for both <b>offline and online POS systems.</b>
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        With a proven track record of integrating widely used POS systems in Saudi Arabia — including{" "}
        <b>SAGE, AX, Denali,</b> and more — Accqrate has successfully helped businesses from{" "}
        <b>retail, pharma, and education sectors</b> achieve <b>E-invoicing compliance.</b>
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Here’s how Accqrate’s integrators solve the problem:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">
        1. Offline POS Billing Software Integrator
      </h3>

      <img

        className="w-full mb-4 rounded-lg"
        alt="Offline POS Billing Software"
      />
      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This solution is ideal for <b>offline POS systems</b> that operate without a constant internet
        connection. Many retail shops use standalone POS devices that store data locally and reconcile with
        the server at the end of the business day.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Here’s how the <b>Accqrate Offline POS ZATCA Integrator</b> works:
      </p>

      <ul className="story pl-5 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>
          A lightweight <b>.exe file</b> is installed on the POS device.
        </li>
        <li>
          The POS system communicates with the .exe through a <b>localhost call</b> to generate a 
          <b>ZATCA-compliant QR code</b> in real time.
        </li>
        <li>The QR code is printed on the customer invoice.</li>
        <li>
          At the end of the day, the integrator pushes approved XML files to ZATCA servers for compliance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Alternative Solution:</h3>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If your POS system cannot modify the PDF invoice to include a QR code, Accqrate offers an alternative:
      </p>

      <ul className="story pl-5 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>
          <b>Accqrate generates the compliant invoice</b> on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          The compliant invoice can be sent to the customer <b>via email or WhatsApp</b> automatically.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This solution is best suited for <b>online POS systems</b> that communicate in real time with their 
        servers. Accqrate provides <b>cloud-based APIs</b> that interact directly with ZATCA’s servers to ensure instant compliance.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Here’s how the <b>Accqrate Online POS Integrator</b> works:
      </p>

      <ul className="story pl-5 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>The POS system generates the customer invoice.</li>
        <li>
          Accqrate’s cloud API connects with ZATCA and gets the <b>invoice approval in milliseconds.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          The cashier can immediately issue a <b>fully compliant invoice</b> to the customer.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your POS system cannot update the PDF print format, Accqrate can <b>generate and print</b> the 
          compliant invoice using the same template you currently use.
        </li>
