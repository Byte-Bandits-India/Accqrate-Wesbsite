        <T>Introduction: The Changing Landscape of POS Systems in Saudi Arabia</T>
      </h3>

        <T>
          Point of Sales (POS) systems are critical to improving customer satisfaction and ensuring seamless
          business operations. However, with the launch of{' '}
          <b>E-invoicing Phase 2 by ZATCA (Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority), </b>
          businesses in Saudi Arabia face new challenges in integrating legacy POS systems with ZATCA’s
          compliance requirements.
        </T>
      </p>
      <p className="story">
        <T>
          Our research reveals that <b>30-40% of businesses</b> continue to use outdated, standalone POS
          machines that cannot communicate with external systems like ZATCA. Migrating to a modern POS system
          isn’t always feasible, especially for businesses heavily reliant on their existing setup.

      <h3 style={{ fontSize: '19px' }}>The Challenge: Integrating Legacy POS Systems with ZATCA</h3>
      <p className="story">
        <T>
          Many POS machines currently in use are built on obsolete technology and lack the capability to
          integrate with external systems like ZATCA. Below are the key challenges businesses face when trying
          to achieve compliance:

      <ol>
        <li className="mt-3">
          <T>
            <b>Obsolete Technology:</b> Legacy POS applications are outdated and lack the scalability to
            integrate with modern APIs.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            <b>Offline Functionality:</b> Most POS systems operate offline, meaning they store data locally
            and perform reconciliation at the end of the day.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            <b>Customer Experience:</b> Any changes to POS systems must not increase&nbsp;
            <b>customer waiting time,</b> as this can impact overall satisfaction.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            <b>Inbuilt Print Formats:</b> Many POS devices have fixed invoice formats that are not customizable
            to include QR codes or ZATCA-compliant details.

        <T>The Solution: Accqrate POS ZATCA Integrator</T>
      </h3>
      <p className="story">
        <T>
          To address these challenges, <b>Accqrate</b> developed a range of <b>POS integrators</b> that
          provide seamless <b>ZATCA compliance</b> for both <b>offline and online POS systems.</b>
        </T>
      </p>

          With a proven track record of integrating widely used POS systems in Saudi Arabia — including{' '}
          <b>SAGE, AX, Denali, </b>
          and more — Accqrate has successfully helped businesses from{' '}
          <b>retail, pharma, and education sectors</b> achieve <b>E-invoicing compliance.</b>
        </T>

      <p className="story">
        <T>
          This solution is ideal for <b>offline POS systems</b> that operate without a constant internet
          connection. Many retail shops use standalone POS devices that store data locally and reconcile with
          the server at the end of the business day.

      <ol>
        <li className="mt-3">
          <T>
            <b>A lightweight .exe file</b> is installed on the POS device.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            The POS system communicates with the .exe through a <b>local host call</b> to generate a{' '}
            <b>ZATCA-compliant QR code</b> in real-time.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>The QR code is printed on the customer invoice.</T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            At the end of the day, the integrator pushes the approved XML files to ZATCA servers for
            compliance.
          </T>
        </li>

      <p className="story">
        <T>
          This solution is best suited for <b>online POS systems</b> that communicate in real-time with their
          servers. In this case, Accqrate provides <b>cloud-based APIs</b> that interact directly with ZATCA’s
          servers to ensure instant compliance.

            Accqrate’s cloud API connects with ZATCA and gets the <b>invoice approval in milliseconds.</b>

        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            If your POS system cannot update the PDF print format, Accqrate can <b>generate and print</b> the
            compliant invoice using the same template you currently use.
