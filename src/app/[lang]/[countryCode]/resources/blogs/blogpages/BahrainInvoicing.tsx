            in Bahrain is progressively heading towards the implementation of
            e-invoicing in the nation. By soliciting input from the public
            through the Bahrain Tender Board, the NBR aims to refine existing
            legalities and bolster the advent of e-invoicing. With neighboring
            countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia successfully adopting
            e-invoicing, Bahrain's move signifies a growing regional trend
            towards digital transformation in financial processes.

        <T>What is E-Invoicing?</T>
      </h3>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <T>
          E-invoicing is not merely a digital copy of a paper invoice; it
          involves the full-fledged process of electronically issuing invoices
          and related Credit or Debit Notes (CDNs). This process enables the
          exchange and processing of invoices and CDNs in a structured
          electronic format between supplier, customer, and tax authority, using
          integrated e-invoicing solutions. Once issued, e-invoices cannot be
          modified, requiring separate notes for any corrections, thus enhancing
          efficiency, accuracy, and transparency.

        <T>Why Introduce E-Invoicing in Bahrain?</T>
      </h3>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <T>The rationale behind introducing e-invoicing in Bahrain centers on three objectives:</T>

        <li>
          <b><T>Supporting Businesses:</T></b>{" "}
          <T>
            By digitizing the invoicing process, e-invoicing levels the playing
            field and eases compliance burdens, enabling efficient operation.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><T>Enhancing Economic Data:</T></b>{" "}

            policies, influencing the growth and stability of Bahrain's economy.

          <b><T>Combating Tax Leakages:</T></b>{" "}
          <T>
            Ensuring greater transparency and accuracy in VAT compliance,

          E-invoicing applies to VAT-Registered Businesses and Third Parties
          Issuing Tax Invoices, with variations based on business nature,
          turnover, transactions, and other factors. The NBR may adopt a phased
          approach, starting with larger entities, to ease the transition.

          While the official timeline has yet to be announced, expectations
          point to an 18-month horizon, subject to NBR's internal
          considerations. Close monitoring and early preparation can smooth the
          transition to this new system.
