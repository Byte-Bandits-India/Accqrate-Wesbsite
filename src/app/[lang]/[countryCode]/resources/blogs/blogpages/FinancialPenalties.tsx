        <T>
          The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) re-launched an initiative to cancel fines and exempt
          financial penalties imposed on taxpayers for six months, beginning on <b>June 1, 2022</b>, and
          ending on <b>November 30, 2022</b>. This program was introduced to mitigate the financial strain on
          businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </T>
      </p>

      <p className="story">
        <T>
          <b>Note (Updated)</b>: While the exemption period mentioned above ended on November 30, 2022, ZATCA
          has periodically introduced and extended certain programs to support taxpayers. As of the latest
          press releases in 2023 and 2024, there have been <b>no further blanket extensions</b> of this
          specific exemption initiative. However, ZATCA continues to announce targeted relief measures on a
          case-by-case basis. Taxpayers are advised to regularly monitor official ZATCA announcements for any
          new or upcoming relief programs.

      <p className="story">
        <T>
          Under the initial exemption (June 1 – November 30, 2022), the cancellation of fines covered the
          following areas:
        </T>
        <ol>
          <li className="mt-3"><b>Late registration</b> in all tax systems</li>
          <li><b>Late payments</b></li>

      <hr />
      <h3 style={{ fontSize: '19px' }}>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
      <p className="story">
        <T>
          To qualify for and fully benefit from the exemption initiative (when it was in effect), ZATCA
          specified the following requirements:
        </T>
        <ol>
          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>VAT Registration:</b> Individuals or entities not yet registered for VAT had to register.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Submission of All Due Returns:</b> Any outstanding returns had to be filed.
          </li>
          <li>

          <b>Note (Updated):</b> Even though the broad exemption period has closed, taxpayers who fall behind
          on payments or disclosures should still proactively contact ZATCA. The authority may allow
          installment plans or other accommodations to facilitate compliance and minimize penalties, but these
          are handled on a <b>case-by-case basis</b>.
