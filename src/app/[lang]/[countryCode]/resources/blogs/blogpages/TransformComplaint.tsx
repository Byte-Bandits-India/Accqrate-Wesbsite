        <T>ENABLING MARKET PLACES WITH E-INVOICING</T>
      </h3>
      <p className="story text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        <T>
          Marketplaces have seen year-on-year growth both in the Kingdom and globally. By nature, a
          marketplace involves bi-directional transactions between buyers and sellers, making e-invoicing a
          critical component for compliance and operational efficiency. As the Zakat, Tax and Customs
          Authority (ZATCA) enforces stringent e-invoicing mandates, modern marketplaces must integrate
          seamlessly to remain competitive and compliant. This article explores the significance of
          e-invoicing for marketplaces, common challenges, and how Accqrate can facilitate a smooth journey
          toward compliance.

        <T>Why Do Marketplaces Need Faster E-Invoicing Scalability?</T>

      <p className="story text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        <T>
          Since December 2019, ZATCA has made e-invoicing a legal obligation in Saudi Arabia. This regulation
          compels marketplaces to have efficient invoice processing systems and real-time integrations to
          meet compliance standards. Unlike traditional B2B or B2C models, marketplaces demand a more
          sophisticated approach due to the multiple parties involved — buyers, sellers, and the platform
          provider.

          Although many companies in the Kingdom are transitioning to e-invoicing, some remain reluctant to
          move from legacy systems. Marketplaces often assume that buyers and sellers will manage their
          e-invoicing on their own — overlooking the competitive edge that a fully integrated compliance
          system provides.

      </h3>
      <p className="story text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        <T>
          When a buyer procures a seller’s product or service, the marketplace application should
          automatically generate a compliant e-invoice through a ZATCA-approved solution. This integration
          happens in real time — triggering the e-invoice submission to ZATCA servers the moment the invoice
          is raised.

      </h3>
      <p className="story text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        <T>
          Buyers need compliant invoices to claim VAT. A non-compliant invoice prevents the buyer from
          accounting for VAT, which can deter them from using a non-compliant platform. Ensuring compliant
          e-invoicing not only meets legal obligations but also fosters buyer loyalty.

          Marketplace providers often charge transaction or subscription fees. For these charges, they must
